- make a sabayon profile for fun
- support syslinux boot
- support lilo for mdraid
- have a dialog layer that would translate to a working kicktoo import
    have dialogs/ output same as ./kicktoo -u
- make profiles:
    gentoo-noboot-noinitramfs.profile
    gentoo-noboot-noinitramfs-kbin.profile
- make chroot.sh more usable
- port all working gentoo profiles to funtoo
- find an elegant way to split the kicktoo file for readability and design
- find a way to fix profile structure (source kbin|gpt|etc?)
- what if lvm over luks?
- add option to erase disk to luks profiles

= Issues found when install Gentoo 20180315 Release = 
-----------------------------------------------------
- "sfdisk -uM" is deprecated. So the part command in profile not work with latest livecd, have to be fixed
    Currently it use the following syntax to create partition.
    echo -e ",100,83,\n,2048,82,\n,,83," | sfdisk -uM /dev/sda 
    The right way to create partition is to pass number together with unit:
    echo -e ",100M,83,\n,2048M,82,\n,,83," | sfdisk /dev/sda
- "mount -t ext2 /dev/sda1 /mnt/gentoo/boot -o defaults", not work because boot dir not yet cretaed under /mnt/gentoo
    The right way to fix the issues is to create /mnt/gentoo/bot immediatly after the /dev/sda3 is mounted to /mnt/gentoo
- grub:2 should use the same command as grub version 1.
- fetch_file should delete link file first to avoid link error.
